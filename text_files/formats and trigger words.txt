Normalization of Time in English (US and US)

Our default normalization output is in the 12 hour format: hours and minutes are read as numbers that range from one to eleven. i.e. 6:26 would be six twenty-six, 15:30 would be three thirty.
time is normalized together with am/pm, i.e. 13:00 would be one PM. In any case, if am/pm is mentioned, it is left as is.
for a 24 hour format output, at any time greater than 12:00, the hours range from thirteen to twenty three, i.e. 13:20 would be thirteen twenty.
